## Detector efficiency curve calculator

This notebook can be used to apply a custom detector efficiency envelope to simulated DTSA-II spectra.

As pointed out [here](https://probesoftware.com/smf/index.php?topic=1225.msg9676#msg9676) by Nicholas Ritchie, one can alternatively modify the `custom.csv` file in DTSA-II with the desired transmission percentages.
