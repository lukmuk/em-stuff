# EM Excel Spreadsheets

Some spreadsheets for quick calculations. Should hopefully work with LibreOffice.

## ReciPro_DiffractionScaler

Helper for diffraction simulations with [ReciPro](https://github.com/seto77/ReciPro). Fill in values for the blue fields.

- Calculate scale for given values in ReciPro or... (`Get Scale` area)

- Calculate scale for ReciPro (mm/pix, Camera length) for given experimental image (`Set Scale` area)

## ESEM_RelativeHumidity

Calculates the relative humidity in % in an SEM chamber based on (i) chamber pressure and (ii) sample temperature.
